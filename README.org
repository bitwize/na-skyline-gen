* Rationale

I wanted to create a city skyline as a background for my
puzzle-platformer [[https://github.com/bitwize/nullawesome][NullAwesome]]. I was too lazy to draw the buildings by
hand, so I wrote a little program to generate them for me.

* Requirements

[[https://gambitscheme.org][Gambit Scheme]] v4.9.5 or higher is required. And that's it, really.

* How to use

Say:

: gsi na-skyline-gen.scm >skyline.pnm

Then use your favorite image editor or conversion tool to view,
change, or convert the PNM file that was output into a more convenient format.

Included as ~sample-skyline.pnm~ is an example of this program's output.
